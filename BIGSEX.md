Ctrl+Alt+Del (CAD) is a gaming-related webcomic[1] and animated series written by Tim Buckley. The name of the comic refers to the Windows command Control-Alt-Delete.[2] Premiering on October 23, 2002, the comic's focus has gradually shifted away from single strip gags towards longer story arcs and greater continuity through the use of video game references. Ctrl+Alt+Del currently is updated every Monday, Wednesday and Friday.

"Loss", sometimes referred to as "Loss.jpg", is a strip published on June 2, 2008, by Tim Buckley for his gaming-related webcomic Ctrl+Alt+Del. Set during a storyline in which the main character Ethan and his fiancée Lilah are expecting their first child, the strip—presented as a four-panel comic with no dialogue—shows Ethan entering a hospital, where he sees Lilah weeping in a hospital bed: she has suffered a miscarriage. Buckley cited events in his life as inspiration for the comic.
